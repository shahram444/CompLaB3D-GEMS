11_surrogate  --  POST-PROCESSING

A fitted network standing in for the linear program.

  reads   output/summary.csv   one row per diagnostic interval
          output/*.log         the solver log, if it was captured
  writes  nothing; prints a verdict

Self-contained: standard library only, nothing imported from tools/. Run it
after the solver, or let pipeline.sh run it for you:

    python3 postprocess.py

WHY A VERDICT AND NOT A PICTURE. A field plot looks equally plausible whether or
not the run conserved mass. Check the run first; plot it once you know it is
worth looking at.

WHICH TOTALS CAN BE BALANCED AT ALL. A species held at a Dirichlet boundary is
supplied from outside the domain, so its total is not conserved and never will
be. Naming it in a conservation check guarantees a failure that means nothing.
Only closed species are balanced below. For this case:

    acetate      OPEN    (Dirichlet / Neumann), supplied from outside
    Fe3          OPEN    (Dirichlet / Neumann), supplied from outside
